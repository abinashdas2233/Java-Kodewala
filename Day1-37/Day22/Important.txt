String:-
1.string can be created in two ways:-
			1.using string literal Ex= String str="Mihir" //string literal also 			
			considered as an object.
			2.using new keyword.ex= String str=new String("das")
2.if declare string using new keyword then string will get memory location in heap.
4.String literal take places in scp(String cosnstant pool).no garbage collection thread is present in scp.
5.suppose ,if the multiple string literal having same content all string literal having a common object.it indicates same memory location in SCP.
6.but using new keyword ,if string object created ,wether content same or not it will create separate object in heap segment.
7.using new keyword string object  creation is useful when content isn't matter .

Memory Management important:-
1.before loading java program jvm will reserve some memory in ram.
2.there are 3 kind memory need for java programme exicution-
				1.meta-space
				2.stack
				3.heap
3.all static variable ,static method & static block & class(byte code) stored in meta space.
4.no garbage collection thread present in metaspace to clear memory.
5.In the if any object not required then we can intiallize that object with null value,then garbage collection automatically come to remove particular object from memory location.
6.we can explicitly call garbage collection thread using System.gc() but it doesn't advisible to use in real time project ,because it will slow down or dead when gc will call . instance of this we can intialize object with null.
7.jvm can call the gc at any time ,when jvm will get trigger during high memory consumption or after programme exicution.



heap:-
1.instance variable,object get allocation at heap.
2.Gc runs on heap
3.inside heap another dedicated aree is present which is called string pool,but don't have gc for it.String litteral get memory allocation here.



stack:-
1.local variable ,method's call get allocation at stack memory segment.
